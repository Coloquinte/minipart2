# Minipart

Minipart is a hypergraph partitioning tool: it partitions a hypergraph into several blocks while minimizing the number of edges that are cut.
Its goal is to work for all kinds of variations of the hypergraph partitioning problem, including the complex cost functions that arise in many practical problems.
